## Features
HTTP responses sent by some service provider contain special headers:
1. receive general header information as `status`, `powered by`, `server engine`

2. the secure information is based on the presence of the `strict-transport-security` tag

3. the header `x-cache` generated by AWS CloudFront having the value` Miss from cloudfront` or `Hit from cloudfront`

4. the `x-amz-cf-pop` header showing the AWS CloudFront point of presence that served the request

<br />
<div align="center">The service offers a high level view of these headers.</div>
<br />

## Documentation
### ** Backend part **
The back-end consists of a NodeJS API exposing a single entry point on the root path `/api/getHeader` and accepting a `url` parameter.

The service exposed by the API consists in making the call to the URL given as a parameter and retrieving the HTTP headers useful to build the response expected by the front-end.
